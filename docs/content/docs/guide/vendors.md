## How vendors are created

Vendors can be created in two ways:

1. **Directly** on the Vendors tab: enter Edit mode (<kbd>i</kbd>), press <kbd>a</kbd>
2. **Implicitly** when adding a quote or service log entry -- type a vendor
   name and micasa finds or creates the record

## Editing a vendor

Navigate to the Vendors tab, enter Edit mode (<kbd>i</kbd>), and press <kbd>e</kbd> on the
cell you want to change, or <kbd>E</kbd> to open the full edit form. Edits to a
vendor's contact info propagate to all quotes and service log entries that
reference that vendor.

## Cross-tab navigation

The `Vendor` column on the <a href="/docs/guide/quotes/" class="tab-pill">Quotes</a> tab is a live link (shown with `→` in the header). Press <kbd>enter</kbd> on
a vendor name in the Quotes table to jump to that vendor's row in the Vendors
tab.

## Drill columns

The `Quotes` and `Jobs` columns show how many quotes and service log entries
reference each vendor. In Nav mode, press <kbd>enter</kbd> to drill into a detail
view showing those records.

## Notes

The edit form includes a `Notes` textarea for free-text annotations about the
vendor. Notes are stored on the vendor record but don't appear as a table
column.

## Incidents

<a href="/docs/guide/incidents/" class="tab-pill">Incidents</a> can optionally link to a
vendor via the `Vendor` column, tracking who you've called or hired for a
particular issue.

## Deletion

Vendors with active quotes, service log entries, or incidents cannot be
deleted -- remove the referencing records first. Once a vendor has no active
references, it can be soft-deleted like any other entity.
