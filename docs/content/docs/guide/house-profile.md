Your home's physical and financial details -- one per database.

![House profile](/images/house-profile.webp)

## First-time setup

On first launch (with no existing database), micasa presents the house profile
form automatically. The `Nickname` field is required; everything else is
optional. Fill in what you know now and come back later for the rest.

## Viewing the profile

Press <kbd>tab</kbd> to toggle the house profile display above the table.
The collapsed view shows a single line with key stats:

```
Elm Street · Springfield, IL · 4bd / 2.5ba · 2,400 sqft · 1987
```

The expanded view shows three sections:

- **Structure**: year built, square footage, bedrooms/bathrooms, foundation,
  wiring, roof, exterior, basement
- **Utilities**: heating, cooling, water, sewer, parking
- **Financial**: insurance carrier/policy/renewal, property tax, HOA

## Editing the profile

Enter Edit mode (<kbd>i</kbd>), then press <kbd>p</kbd> to open the house profile form. The
form is organized into the same sections (Basics, Structure, Utilities,
Financial). Save with <kbd>ctrl+s</kbd>, cancel with <kbd>esc</kbd>.
