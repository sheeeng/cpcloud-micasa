## Adding a document

1. Switch to the Docs tab (<kbd>f</kbd> to cycle forward)
2. Enter Edit mode (<kbd>i</kbd>), press <kbd>a</kbd>
3. Fill in a title and optional file path, then save (<kbd>ctrl+s</kbd>)

If you provide a file path, micasa reads the file into the database as a BLOB
(up to 50 MB). The title auto-fills from the filename when left blank.

### Quick add with extraction

Press <kbd>A</kbd> (shift+a) on the Docs tab to open a streamlined add form that
picks a file and immediately runs the [extraction pipeline](#extraction-pipeline). This is the
fastest way to import a document when you want OCR and LLM hints. The file
picker hides dotfiles by default; press <kbd>H</kbd> to toggle their visibility.

You can also add documents from within a project or appliance detail view --
drill into the `Docs` column and press <kbd>a</kbd>. Documents added this way are
automatically linked to that record.

## Fields

| Column | Type | Description | Notes |
|-------:|------|-------------|-------|
| `ID` | auto | Auto-assigned | Read-only |
| `Title` | text | Document name | Required. Auto-filled from filename if blank |
| `Entity` | text | Linked record | E.g., "project #3". Only shown on top-level Docs tab |
| `Type` | text | MIME type | E.g., "application/pdf", "image/jpeg" |
| `Size` | text | File size | Human-readable (e.g., "2.5 MB"). Read-only |
| `Notes` | notes | Free-text annotations | Press <kbd>enter</kbd> to preview |
| `Updated` | date | Last modified | Read-only |

## File handling

- **Storage**: files are stored as BLOBs inside the SQLite database, so
  `micasa backup backup.db` backs up everything -- no sidecar files
- **Size limit**: 50 MB per file
- **MIME detection**: automatic from file contents and extension
- **Checksum**: SHA-256 hash stored for integrity
- **Cache**: when you open a document (<kbd>o</kbd>), micasa extracts it to the XDG
  cache directory and opens it with your OS viewer

## Entity linking

Documents can be linked to any record type: projects, incidents, appliances,
quotes, maintenance items, vendors, or service log entries. The link is set
automatically when adding from a drill view, or can be left empty for
standalone documents.

The `Entity` column on the top-level Docs tab shows which record a document
belongs to (e.g., "project #3", "appliance #7").

## Searching documents

Press <kbd>ctrl+f</kbd> on the Docs tab to open a search overlay. It searches
across document titles, notes, and extracted text using SQLite's FTS5
full-text search engine.

Results appear instantly as you type. Each result shows the document title,
its entity association (if any), and a snippet of matched text with
highlighted terms. Use <kbd>up</kbd>/<kbd>down</kbd> (or
<kbd>ctrl+k</kbd>/<kbd>ctrl+j</kbd>) to navigate results, <kbd>enter</kbd> to
jump to the document, and <kbd>esc</kbd> to close. Clicking a result also
navigates to it.

The search uses the Porter stemmer, so related word forms match each other
(e.g., searching "painting" also finds "painted" and "paint"). Queries are
case-insensitive. For advanced users, FTS5 operators like `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`,
quoted phrases, and `*` wildcards are supported.

## Drill columns

The `Docs` column appears on the <a href="/docs/guide/projects/" class="tab-pill">Projects</a> and <a href="/docs/guide/appliances/" class="tab-pill">Appliances</a> tabs, showing
how many documents are linked to each record. In Nav mode, press <kbd>enter</kbd> to
drill into a scoped document list for that record.

When you save a document with file data, micasa runs a three-layer extraction
pipeline to pull structured information out of the file. **This pipeline is
under active development** -- results vary by document type, quality, and
available tools. Each layer is independent and degrades gracefully when its
tools are unavailable.

### Layer 1: text extraction

Runs immediately during save. Extracts selectable text from PDFs using
`pdftotext` (from poppler-utils) which preserves reading order and table
layout. Plain-text files are read directly. Images skip this layer entirely.

### Layer 2: OCR

Triggers automatically when text extraction returns little or no text (scanned
PDFs) or when the file is an image (PNG, JPEG, TIFF, etc.). Requires
`tesseract` and at least one image acquisition tool to be installed. If these
tools are missing, OCR is silently skipped.

For PDFs, micasa tries three image acquisition strategies in order:

1. **`pdfimages`** -- extracts embedded image blobs directly (fastest, best quality for scanned PDFs)
2. **`pdftohtml`** -- renders pages to PNG (catches vector-drawn content that `pdfimages` misses)
3. **`pdftoppm`** -- full 300 DPI rasterization (slowest, always works)

Each fallback only runs if the previous tool is missing or produced no usable
images (filtered by a 10 KB minimum size). The overlay shows which tool was
used and how many images it produced, followed by per-page OCR progress.

### Layer 3: LLM extraction

When an LLM is configured, micasa sends the extracted text to a local model
with a JSON Schema constraint that produces structured database operations
(creates and updates) for vendors, quotes, maintenance items, appliances, and
the document itself. The operations are validated against a strict allowlist
before display.

When no LLM is configured (or when OCR/text extraction alone is sufficient),
you can still accept the text and OCR results without running the LLM step.
The extracted text is saved to the document for full-text search regardless.

**This feature is early-stage.** Results vary significantly by model, document
type, and text quality. Invoices and quotes with clear line items tend to work
best; complex multi-page documents or poor OCR output often produce incomplete
or incorrect operations. Always review the proposed changes in the preview
before accepting.

The results appear as a **tabbed table preview** below the pipeline steps --
one tab per affected table, using the same column layout as the main UI. The
user reviews proposed changes and explicitly accepts before anything touches
the database. The LLM never writes directly. Press <kbd>r</kbd> to rerun the LLM step
if the first result is poor.

The extraction model can be configured separately from the chat model. See
[Configuration]({{< ref "/docs/reference/configuration" >}}) for the
`[extraction]` section.

### Extraction overlay

An overlay shows real-time progress during OCR and LLM extraction. Each step
displays a status icon, elapsed time, and detail (page count, character count,
model name). The overlay has two modes:

**Pipeline mode** (default): navigate steps, expand logs, review the dimmed
operation preview below.

**Explore mode** (press <kbd>x</kbd>): full table navigation of the proposed operations.
Pipeline steps dim and the table preview becomes interactive with row/column
cursors and tab switching. Press <kbd>x</kbd> or <kbd>esc</kbd> to return to pipeline mode.

When extraction completes successfully, press <kbd>a</kbd> to accept the results and
apply them. On error the overlay stays open showing which step failed. Press
<kbd>esc</kbd> at any time to cancel and close.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| <kbd>a</kbd> | Accept results (when done, no errors) |
| <kbd>ctrl+b</kbd> | Background the extraction (continue working while it runs) |
| <kbd>esc</kbd> | Cancel / exit explore mode |
| <kbd>j</kbd>/<kbd>k</kbd> | Navigate steps (pipeline) or rows (explore) |
| <kbd>h</kbd>/<kbd>l</kbd> | Navigate columns (explore) |
| <kbd>b</kbd>/<kbd>f</kbd> | Switch tabs (explore) |
| <kbd>enter</kbd> | Expand/collapse step logs |
| <kbd>r</kbd> | Rerun LLM step |
| <kbd>x</kbd> | Toggle explore mode |

See [Keybindings]({{< ref "/docs/reference/keybindings" >}}) for the full
reference.

### Requirements

Each pipeline layer depends on external tools. All are optional -- the
document always saves regardless of which tools are installed.

| Pipeline step | File types | Tools needed | Without it |
|---------------|------------|--------------|------------|
| Text extraction | PDF | `pdftotext` | No digital text extracted |
| Text extraction | `text/*` | _(none)_ | _(always available)_ |
| OCR | Scanned PDF | `tesseract` + (`pdfimages`, `pdftohtml`, or `pdftoppm`) | OCR skipped |
| OCR | Images (PNG, JPEG, TIFF, ...) | `tesseract` | OCR skipped |
| LLM extraction | Any with extracted text | Ollama (or compatible) | No structured extraction attempted |

`pdftotext` and `pdftoppm` ship together in the **poppler** utilities package.

#### Installing dependencies

| Platform | Command |
|----------|---------|
| Ubuntu / Debian | `sudo apt install poppler-utils tesseract-ocr` |
| Fedora / RHEL | `sudo dnf install poppler-utils tesseract` |
| Arch | `sudo pacman -S poppler tesseract` |
| macOS (Homebrew) | `brew install poppler tesseract` |
| Windows (MSYS2) | `pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-poppler mingw-w64-x86_64-tesseract-ocr` |
| Nix | `nix shell 'nixpkgs#poppler-utils' 'nixpkgs#tesseract'` |

The micasa dev shell (`nix develop`) includes both tools automatically.

For the LLM step, install [Ollama](https://ollama.com) and pull a model
(a small model like `qwen2.5:7b` works well). See
[Configuration]({{< ref "/docs/reference/configuration" >}}) for the
`[extraction]` section.

## Inline editing

In Edit mode, press <kbd>e</kbd> on the `Title` or `Notes` column to edit inline. Press
<kbd>e</kbd> on any other column (or <kbd>E</kbd> from any column) to open the full edit form.
