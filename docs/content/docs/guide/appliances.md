## Adding an appliance

1. Switch to the Appliances tab
2. Enter Edit mode (<kbd>i</kbd>), press <kbd>a</kbd>
3. Fill in the identity and details forms

Only the `Name` is required.

## Fields

| Column | Type | Description | Notes |
|-------:|------|-------------|-------|
| `ID` | auto | Auto-assigned | Read-only |
| `Name` | text | Appliance name | Required. E.g., "Kitchen Refrigerator" |
| `Brand` | text | Manufacturer | E.g., "LG" |
| `Model` | text | Model number | For warranty lookups and replacements |
| `Serial` | text | Serial number | |
| `Location` | text | Where in the house | E.g., "Kitchen", "Basement" |
| `Purchased` | date | Purchase date | [Date input]({{< ref "/docs/using/date-input" >}}) |
| `Age` | computed | Time since purchase | Read-only. E.g., "3y 2m", "8m", "<1m" |
| `Warranty` | warranty | Warranty expiry | Green when active, red when expired. Shows on dashboard when expiring |
| `Cost` | money | Purchase price | Formatted in your [configured currency]({{< ref "/docs/reference/configuration#locale-section" >}}) |
| `Maint` | drill | Maintenance count | Press <kbd>enter</kbd> to view linked maintenance |
| `Docs` | drill | Document count | Press <kbd>enter</kbd> to view linked documents |

## Warranty tracking

Enter the warranty expiry date when you add an appliance. The
<a href="/docs/guide/dashboard/" class="tab-pill">Dashboard</a> shows appliances with warranties expiring within
90 days (or recently expired within 30 days) in the "Expiring Soon" section.

## Maintenance drill

The `Maint` column shows how many maintenance items are linked to this
appliance. In Nav mode, navigate to the `Maint` column and press <kbd>enter</kbd> to
open a detail view showing those maintenance items (without the Appliance
column, since it's redundant).

From the detail view you can add, edit, or delete maintenance items. Press
<kbd>esc</kbd> to return to the Appliances table.

## Incidents

<a href="/docs/guide/incidents/" class="tab-pill">Incidents</a> can optionally link to an
appliance via the `Appliance` column. This lets you track which equipment is
involved in a household issue. Appliances with active incidents cannot be
deleted -- resolve or unlink the incidents first.

## Notes

The edit form includes a `Notes` textarea for free-text annotations. Notes are
stored on the appliance record but don't appear as a table column.

## Inline editing

All columns except `ID`, `Age`, and `Maint` support inline editing. Press <kbd>e</kbd>
in Edit mode on a cell to edit just that field. Press <kbd>E</kbd> from any column to
open the full edit form.
