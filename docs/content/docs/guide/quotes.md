The Quotes tab helps you compare vendor quotes for your projects.

![Quotes table](/images/quotes.webp)

## Prerequisites

You need at least one project before you can add a quote, since every quote
is linked to a project.

## Adding a quote

1. Switch to the Quotes tab
2. Enter Edit mode (<kbd>i</kbd>), press <kbd>a</kbd>
3. Select a project, enter vendor details, then cost breakdown

## Fields

| Column | Type | Description | Notes |
|-------:|------|-------------|-------|
| `ID` | auto | Auto-assigned | Read-only |
| `Project` | link | Linked project | Shows `→` in header -- press <kbd>enter</kbd> to jump |
| `Vendor` | link | Vendor name | Required. Shows `→` in header -- press <kbd>enter</kbd> to jump to vendor |
| `Total` | money | Total quote amount | Required |
| `Labor` | money | Labor portion | Optional |
| `Mat` | money | Materials portion | Optional |
| `Other` | money | Other costs | Optional |
| `Recv` | date | Date received | [Date input]({{< ref "/docs/using/date-input" >}}) |

The edit form also includes a `Notes` textarea for free-text annotations about
the quote. Notes are stored on the quote record but don't appear as a table
column.

## Vendor management

When you add a quote, you enter a vendor name. If a vendor with that name
already exists, micasa links to the existing record. If not, it creates a new
one.

The vendor form also collects optional contact info: contact name, email,
phone, and website. These are stored on the vendor record and shared across
all quotes and service log entries for that vendor.

## Cost comparison

To compare quotes for a project, sort the Quotes tab by the `Project` column
(<kbd>s</kbd> on the `Project` column header) to group quotes by project. Then compare
the `Total`, `Labor`, `Mat`, and `Other` columns across vendors.

## Project link

The `Project` column is a foreign key. In Nav mode, press <kbd>enter</kbd> on the
`Project` cell to jump to the linked project in the <a href="/docs/guide/projects/" class="tab-pill">Projects</a> tab.
